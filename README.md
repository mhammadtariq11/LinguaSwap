# LinguaSwap

Hi!
This is **LinguaSwap** – a front-end web project I built to practice and showcase my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. It's a language and culture exchange platform idea where users could eventually connect, learn languages, and explore new cultures.

While this is just the **frontend**, it reflects how I imagine modern, friendly platforms should look and feel — clean, responsive, and welcoming.

## What is LinguaSwap?

**LinguaSwap** is a conceptual platform designed for people who want to:

- Connect with native speakers of different languages
- Join cultural events and language exchange meetups
- Practice conversation with locals
- Learn languages like English, Hungarian, Urdu, Korean, German, and Spanish

The UI includes smooth sections, image carousels, responsive layouts, and interactive components – all built using:

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with custom styling and responsiveness)
- Bootstrap 5
- A sprinkle of vanilla JavaScript ✨

This was my buisness Idea in the first semester and then in the second semesster I made the front end as a assignment of corse web development.

This was also my attempt to practice:

- Writing clean, responsive layouts
- Working with multi-page site structure
- Using Bootstrap components and layout systems
- Custom JS interactions (like hover effects)
